# The total supply of the market tokens does not decrease after transfer to zero address

# Impact

* It will cause accounting issues. Parameters that uses `scaledTotalSupply` (protocol fee, required liquidity etc) will be greater than the actual amount.
    
* It will cause internal and external trackers to be out of sync
    

## Proof of Concept

The protocol has underlying tokens and market tokens. Lenders deposit underlying tokens and get market tokens, which earn interest. When they want to withdraw their assets, they will burn their market tokens and get the underlying tokens back with some interest. All of the internal accounting is made with these market tokens and they are tracked as `scaled` balances. Market tokens are minted and burned and these actions affect `scaledTotalSupply`.

Market tokens can also be transferred between accounts like a regular ERC20 token.

```
  function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external virtual nonReentrant returns (bool) {
    _transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
    return true;
  }
```

```
  function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual { //@audit There is no check if the to == 0
    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();
    uint104 scaledAmount = state.scaleAmount(amount).toUint104();

    if (scaledAmount == 0) {
      revert NullTransferAmount();
    }

    Account memory fromAccount = _getAccount(from);
    fromAccount.scaledBalance -= scaledAmount;
    _accounts[from] = fromAccount;

    Account memory toAccount = _getAccount(to); 
    toAccount.scaledBalance += scaledAmount; //@audit There is no check if the to == 0
    _accounts[to] = toAccount;

    _writeState(state);
    emit Transfer(from, to, amount); //@audit it will emit a transfer to 0 address. External trackers will think this is a token burn. 
  }
```

As you can see above, there is no check if the transfer is made to the zero address. Normally, transferring to zero addresses means burning and should decrease the total supply. But in this case, the total supply does not decrease. Internal balance tracking still thinks the total supply is the same.

Additionally, I would like to point out this comment in the WildcatMarketBase.sol contract: *"Emit transfer for external trackers to indicate burn."*  
[https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/c5df665f0bc2ca5df6f06938d66494b11e7bdada/src/market/WildcatMarketBase.sol#L523C1-L524C68](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/c5df665f0bc2ca5df6f06938d66494b11e7bdada/src/market/WildcatMarketToken.sol#L36C1-L39C4)

```solidity
file: WildcatMarketBase.sol
523.    // Emit transfer for external trackers to indicate burn.
524.    emit Transfer(address(this), address(0), normalizedAmountPaid);
```

This gives the idea that the internal and external balance tracking will be out of sync because of allowing transfer to zero addresses.

Another effect of this issue is some functions that use total supply while calculating important parameters will return wrong values. For example [applyProtocolFee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/c5df665f0bc2ca5df6f06938d66494b11e7bdada/src/libraries/FeeMath.sol#L47C27-L47C50), [liquidityRequired](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/c5df665f0bc2ca5df6f06938d66494b11e7bdada/src/libraries/MarketState.sol#L91C39-L91C62), and [totalDebts()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/c5df665f0bc2ca5df6f06938d66494b11e7bdada/src/libraries/MarketState.sol#L140C29-L140C52).

## Tools Used

Manual review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

I would recommend not allowing transfer to zero addresses, or burning tokens that are transferred to zero addresses
