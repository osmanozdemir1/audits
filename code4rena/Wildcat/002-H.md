# `WildcatMarket::closeMarket()` can never be called

# Vulnerability details

## Impact

A Wildcat market can never be closed.

## Proof of Concept

Borrowers can create markets and control these markets through controller contracts.  
A market can be closed by calling `WildcatMarket::closeMarket()`function and this function has `onlyController` modifier.  
[https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/c5df665f0bc2ca5df6f06938d66494b11e7bdada/src/market/WildcatMarket.sol#L142](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/c5df665f0bc2ca5df6f06938d66494b11e7bdada/src/market/WildcatMarket.sol#L142)

```solidity
  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {
    ...
  }
```

This function must be called by the controller contract but the controller contract does not make any calls to the `WildcatMarket` contract to close the market.  
[https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/main/src/WildcatMarketController.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/c5df665f0bc2ca5df6f06938d66494b11e7bdada/src/market/WildcatMarket.sol#L142)

It is impossible to close a market at this moment. Normally, closing a market updates the annual interest rate to 0, and sets the reserve ratio to 0.

It is possible to work around this situation and manually set the annual interest rate to 0 without closing the market, but the reserve ratio can not be set manually. This will make the market prone to delinquency, which will cause borrowers to pay a penalty APR.

## Tools Used

Manual review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

I would recommend adding a function in the controller contract to close the market.
