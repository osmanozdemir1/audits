# `GeVault::pushTick()` and `GeVault::shiftTick()` doesn't check if the tokenisableRange instance is ticker or ranger

# Vulnerability details

GeVault.sol contract has a `ticks` array that holds the ticker instances of the `tokenisableRange.sol` implementations. In this protocol, there will be two `tokenisableRange` instances for every range of the same assets. One of them is a ticker and the other one is a ranger. These instances are proxy implementations and they are [initialized in the RangeManager.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/71c0c0eca8af957202ccdbf5ce2f2a514ffe2e24/contracts/RangeManager.sol#L85C1-L86C132)

As you can see in the TokenisableRange.sol contract, the upper and lower ticks of the ticker and the ranger instances (*for the same assets and the same price ranges*) are calculated differently.

```solidity
file: TokenisableRange.sol
//function: initProxy()
//...
    if (isTicker) { 
      feeTier   = 5;
      int24 midleTick;
      midleTick = (_upperTick + _lowerTick) / 2;
      _upperTick = (midleTick + int24(feeTier)) - (midleTick + int24(feeTier)) % int24(feeTier * 2);
      _lowerTick = _upperTick - int24(feeTier) - int24(feeTier);
      _name     = string(abi.encodePacked("Ticker ", baseSymbol, " ", quoteSymbol, " ", startName, "-", endName));
     _symbol    = string(abi.encodePacked("T-",startName,"_",endName,"-",baseSymbol,"-",quoteSymbol));
    } else {
      feeTier   = 5;
      _lowerTick = (_lowerTick + int24(feeTier)) - (_lowerTick + int24(feeTier)) % int24(feeTier * 2);
      _upperTick = (_upperTick + int24(feeTier)) - (_upperTick + int24(feeTier)) % int24(feeTier * 2);
      _name     = string(abi.encodePacked("Ranger ", baseSymbol, " ", quoteSymbol, " ", startName, "-", endName));
      _symbol   = string(abi.encodePacked("R-",startName,"_",endName,"-",baseSymbol,"-",quoteSymbol));
    }
```

The `ticks` array in the GeVault contract is expected to hold only the tickers, not the rangers. But there is no check if the inputted instance is the ticker or ranger in the `pushTick()` and the `shiftTick()` functions.

```solidity
  /// @notice Add a new ticker to the list
  /// @param tr Tick address
  function pushTick(address tr) public onlyOwner {
    TokenisableRange t = TokenisableRange(tr);
    (ERC20 t0,) = t.TOKEN0();
    (ERC20 t1,) = t.TOKEN1();
    require(t0 == token0 && t1 == token1, "GEV: Invalid TR");
    if (ticks.length == 0) ticks.push(t);
    else {
      // Check that tick is properly ordered
      if (baseTokenIsToken0) 
        require( t.lowerTick() > ticks[ticks.length-1].upperTick(), "GEV: Push Tick Overlap");
      else 
        require( t.upperTick() < ticks[ticks.length-1].lowerTick(), "GEV: Push Tick Overlap");
      
      ticks.push(TokenisableRange(tr));
    }
    emit PushTick(tr);
  }  
```

These functions check if the tick order is proper but this doesn't mean these checks will prevent adding a ranger instead of a ticker.

I acknowledge that these functions are `onlyOwner` and the owner will know which address is a ticker and which one is a ranger. But let's just think about an example with ETH/USDC:  
Assume the protocol will create `tokenisableRange` instances with 100 USD intervals between ETH prices of 1000 USD and 4000 USD. This will make 30 ticker and 30 ranger instances. It's quite possible that there will be hundreds of instances if the intervals are smaller. It is extremely normal for humans to make mistakes and it is not that hard to push a ranger instance to the array without noticing.

## Impact

As I mentioned above, the lower tick and the upper tick of the ticker and ranger contracts are calculated differently. If a ranger instance is mistakenly placed in the `ticks` array, the vault will deposit the assets into different ticks than expected.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

The `tokenisableRange` instances already have a name and a symbol that specifies if that instance is a ticker or a ranger. I would recommend using these variables to check every instance is indeed a ticker while adding tickers to the `ticks` array.
