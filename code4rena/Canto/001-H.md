# `asD` contract owner can not withdraw interests due to incorrect scaling factor

## Vulnerability details

## Impact

* Calculating `maximumWithdrawable` will underflow and revert due to incorrect scaling.
    
* Contract owner won't be able to withdraw earned interests with the `withdrawCarry()` function.
    

## Proof of Concept

Creators can create stablecoins pegged to $NOTE with this protocol and they can earn interest with their creations.

Here is how the minting/burning of these stablecoins and interest mechanism works:

* Users call `asD::mint()` and transfer their $NOTE tokens to mint `asD` stablecoin
    
* `asD` contract immediately deposits these $NOTE tokens to Canto Lending Market and mints `cNOTE`, which earns interest.
    
* Users get a corresponding amount of `asD` stablecoin
    

The `cNOTE` tokens in the lending market earn interest according to `exchangeRate` which is always increasing.

The opposite happens when burning.

* Users request their $NOTE tokens by calling `asD::burn()`
    
* The `asD` contract redeems that amount of $NOTE token from the Canto Lending Market and burns `cNOTE` tokens according to that moment's exchange rate.
    
* Because the exchange rate is increasing, the burned (*redeemed*) cNOTE amount is less than the minted amount, and the difference is the interest that the creator earns.
    

The `asD` contract creator can withdraw these earned interests by calling the `asD::withdrawCarry()` function:  
[https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-canto/blob/335930cd53cf9a137504a57f1215be52c6d67cb3/asD/src/asD.sol#L72](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-canto/blob/335930cd53cf9a137504a57f1215be52c6d67cb3/asD/src/asD.sol#L72)

```
file:asD.sol
    function withdrawCarry(uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {
-->     uint256 exchangeRate = CTokenInterface(cNote).exchangeRateCurrent(); // Scaled by 1 * 10^(18 - 8 + Underlying Token Decimals), i.e. 10^(28) in our case    //@audit-issue According to cToken source code it is scaled by 1e18 - NOT 1e28
        // The amount of cNOTE the contract has to hold (based on the current exchange rate which is always increasing) such that it is always possible to receive 1 NOTE when burning 1 asD
        uint256 maximumWithdrawable = (CTokenInterface(cNote).balanceOf(address(this)) * exchangeRate) /
-->         1e28 -
            totalSupply();
        if (_amount == 0) {
            _amount = maximumWithdrawable;
        } else {
            require(_amount <= maximumWithdrawable, "Too many tokens requested");
        }
       
        // skipped for brevity
    }
```

This function basically checks the current exchange rate, calculates the $NOTE value of the current `cNOTE` balances with this exchange rate, and finds the `maximumWithdrawable` amount as interest.

In this function, the exchange rate is assumed to be scaled by `1e28` as you can see in this comment "`Scaled by 1 * 10^(18 - 8 + Underlying Token Decimals), i.e. 10^(28) in our case`", [this division](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-canto/blob/335930cd53cf9a137504a57f1215be52c6d67cb3/asD/src/asD.sol#L76).

This comment is true based on the [compound docs](https://docs.compound.finance/v2/ctokens/#exchange-rate). However, this is not the case in the actual source code. In the code itself, the returned exchange rate is always [scaled by 1e18](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/a3214f67b73310d547e00fc578e8355911c9d376/contracts/CToken.sol#L272).

```
file: CToken.sol //compound
    /**
     * @notice Accrue interest then return the up-to-date exchange rate
     * @return Calculated exchange rate scaled by 1e18
     */
    function exchangeRateCurrent() override public nonReentrant returns (uint) {
        accrueInterest();
        return exchangeRateStored();
    } 
```

Canto Lending Market is a compound fork and it returns the exchange rate scaled by 1e18 too. It can also be checked by reading the contract in the Canto blockchain explorers.  
`cNOTE` contract address is: `0xEe602429Ef7eCe0a13e4FfE8dBC16e101049504C`  
It can be checked here (*function no 40*): [https://tuber.build/token/0xEe602429Ef7eCe0a13e4FfE8dBC16e101049504C?tab=read\_contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-canto/blob/335930cd53cf9a137504a57f1215be52c6d67cb3/asD/src/asD.sol#L72)

You can see that the live cNOTE contract returns the exchange rate with 18 decimals in the screenshot below:  
[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97894167/283773543-a4d64810-474d-4ff4-8b9d-3b60682f18e6.png](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-canto/blob/335930cd53cf9a137504a57f1215be52c6d67cb3/asD/src/asD.sol#L72)

The `maximumWithdrawable` amount calculation will always underflow due to the exchange rate being 18 decimals but the calculation is made with a hardcoded `1e28` [value](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-canto/blob/335930cd53cf9a137504a57f1215be52c6d67cb3/asD/src/asD.sol#L76).

```solidity
uint256 maximumWithdrawable = (CTokenInterface(cNote).balanceOf(address(this)) * exchangeRate) /
-->         1e28 -
            totalSupply(); //@audit will underflow due to 1e8 - 1e18
```

## Tools Used

Manual review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

I would recommend using 1e18 when scaling the exchange rate instead of 1e28
