# Contextual error when checking the balance deposited to EigenLayer may result in an incorrect deposit limit

## Impact

The total assets in the pool and the deposit limit will be calculated wrong.

* It may not allow depositing even though the actual deposited amount is lower than the limit.
    
* It may allow depositing more than the max limit in case of the share value in the EigenLayer decreases.
    
* Total `getTotalAssetDeposits()` function might return greater value than the maximum deposit limit after some time due to the yield in EigenLayer even if there are no new deposits.
    

## Proof of Concept

In this protocol, users deposit assets in the pool, and these assets will be deposited to the EigenLayer by the protocol. Both EigenLayer and this protocol have maximum deposit limits for supported assets (These limits are 100\_000 ether at the moment).

This protocol calculates the remaining deposit limits with the `getAssetCurrentLimit()` function, which subtracts the already deposited total amounts from the maximum limit.

```
file: LRTDepositPool.sol
    function getAssetCurrentLimit(address asset) public view override returns (uint256) {
        return lrtConfig.depositLimitByAsset(asset) - getTotalAssetDeposits(asset);
    } 
```

Let's examine the `getTotalAssetDeposits()` function:  
[https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-kelp/blob/f751d7594051c0766c7ecd1e68daeb0661e43ee3/src/LRTDepositPool.sol#L47](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-kelp/blob/f751d7594051c0766c7ecd1e68daeb0661e43ee3/src/LRTDepositPool.sol#L56)

```solidity
file: LRTDepositPool.sol
    function getTotalAssetDeposits(address asset) public view override returns (uint256 totalAssetDeposit) {
        (uint256 assetLyingInDepositPool, uint256 assetLyingInNDCs, uint256 assetStakedInEigenLayer) =
            getAssetDistributionData(asset);
        return (assetLyingInDepositPool + assetLyingInNDCs + assetStakedInEigenLayer);
    }
```

This function calculates total asset deposits by summing up all the values in the deposit pool, node delegators, and the EigenLayer.

However, the `assetStakedInEigenLayer` value here is **not the actual deposit amounts** to the EigenLayer, it is the current value (deposit + yield) of the previous deposits.

Let me explain it further.

Here is the `getAssetDistributionData()` function that returns all of these separate values:  
[https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-kelp/blob/f751d7594051c0766c7ecd1e68daeb0661e43ee3/src/LRTDepositPool.sol#L71](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-kelp/blob/f751d7594051c0766c7ecd1e68daeb0661e43ee3/src/LRTDepositPool.sol#L56)

```
file: LRTDepositPool.sol
    function getAssetDistributionData(address asset)
        public
        view
        override
        onlySupportedAsset(asset)
        returns (uint256 assetLyingInDepositPool, uint256 assetLyingInNDCs, uint256 assetStakedInEigenLayer)
    {
        // Question: is here the right place to have this? Could it be in LRTConfig?
        assetLyingInDepositPool = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this));

        uint256 ndcsCount = nodeDelegatorQueue.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < ndcsCount;) {
            assetLyingInNDCs += IERC20(asset).balanceOf(nodeDelegatorQueue[i]);
-->         assetStakedInEigenLayer += INodeDelegator(nodeDelegatorQueue[i]).getAssetBalance(asset); //@audit check what it returns as balance. If this returns deposit + earned yield in eigenlayer, it will cause mismatch
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```

The `assetStakedInEigenLayer` value is returned by the `NodeDelegator::getAssetBalance()` function. Let's check [that one](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-kelp/blob/f751d7594051c0766c7ecd1e68daeb0661e43ee3/src/NodeDelegator.sol#L121C1-L124C6):

```solidity
file: NodeDelegator.sol
    /// @dev Returns the balance of an asset that the node delegator has deposited into the strategy //@audit - It's wrong. It doesn't return the deposited amount. It returns the value of the shares.
    /// @param asset the asset to get the balance of
    /// @return stakedBalance the balance of the asset
    function getAssetBalance(address asset) external view override returns (uint256) { //@audit does it return deposited amount or the current value of the deposits? This might be returning the current value (deposit + yield) of the shares, not the actual deposited amount
        address strategy = lrtConfig.assetStrategy(asset);
        return IStrategy(strategy).userUnderlyingView(address(this)); //@audit - according to EigenLayer codes it returns underlying value of the shares. - !Not the deposited amount
    }
```

As we can see above, this function fetches the balance of an asset from the EigenLayer by calling the [userUnderlyingView()](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/db4506d07b2b9029c31d583d5da6b790484c2b95/src/contracts/strategies/StrategyBase.sol#L249C1-L251C6) (which calls [sharesToUnderlyingView()](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/db4506d07b2b9029c31d583d5da6b790484c2b95/src/contracts/strategies/StrategyBase.sol#L194C1-L206C6)), and it returns the **current value of the shares** not the deposited amount.

When these shares gain value, `assetStakedInEigenLayer` parameter will be greater, leading to the `getTotalAssetDeposits()` function to return a bigger value than the actual deposit amount. Eventually available deposit limit will decrease in time even though there are no new deposits.

The opposite of this can also be possible. In case of a sudden crash or hack or any kind of event in the EigenLayer might decrease the value of these shares. `getTotalAssetDeposits()` returns much less than the actual deposited amount, users can keep depositing to the KelpDao and when the share price returns to normal, the total deposited amount will be much greater than the maximum deposit limit.

Deposited amount should be tracked separately.

## Tools Used

Manual review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

I would recommend tracking deposited amount with a mapping as a storage variable.
